# ada
Ada is an open source personal assistent that integrates in your workflow and cares about you and your data.

## Goals
Ada is meant to fit the needs of the developers. We care deeply about the interest of the public and we welcome all sort of contributions, but our own needs eventually determine the route the project will take.

If you disagree with this, you are of course free to fork the project. This project has been released under GNU General Public License v3.0.

Eventually, Ada should be able to do the popular functions like playing music, showing directions, telling you the weather and looking up things. We also want to work on technical requirements that are important to us.

Data is very important to us and therefore we will never force an API on you. You can always change which API you want to use for which functionality and we will never send more data than necessary.
